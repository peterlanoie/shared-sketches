# Beer Caddy

This is a woodworking project I did for a friend's wedding.

See this video for a quick 360 look: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg_fBXHgJao

The final project differed a bit from the original sketch as I discovered some of the ideas I had didn't work and various tweaks needed to be made to satisfy the needs of the basic mechanics of the handle action.

The sketch is provided as-is with the understanding that some things changed and it's not representative of the final outcome. See the 'variations' section below for details.

You can [download the SketchUp file](beer-caddy.skp) to see the whole thing including some of the original ideas that were scrapped and to get an idea of the simple mechanics involved. There are also a bunch of photos in this directory of the project along the way.

# Materials
The box is constructed out of red oak and walnut wood. There are a few metal parts for the springs and the brass screws.

# Finish
The wood is finished to a high gloss in many layers of Bush oil with some sanding in between.

# Key variations of the final result

## Springs
I had wanted to make this entirely out of wood, including the springs. However, I encountered 2 problems.

### Handle spring
As seen in the sketch, I used a double "leaf" spring design to raise the handle. This generally worked, but the wood eventually remembered the position under tension a bit and the handle sat low which ruined the closed appearance.

### Bottle bay springs
The multi-segment leaf springs I tried for pulling the bottle bays back in simply didn't have the necessary deflection over their length. I abandoned that approach and used some repurposed steel from the spine of a replaced windshield wiper blade instead. This proved satisfactory as a spring to augment the natural return of the bay under its own weight, and certain with the added weight of 3 bottles.

## Fastening the top and bottom
Originally planning to glue the top dado and bottom rabbet joints once finally assembled, I decided instead to use brass screws so that the box was serviceable should it need a tuneup. The clocked screw heads added a nice accent to the whole piece.
